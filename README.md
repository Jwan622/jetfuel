# This is the README for jetfuel, a bitly-like program that shortens URLs.

This is my Turing module 4 intermission project.

# Instructions
* clone the repo
* in the top level folder, run bundle (this requires for you to have bundle) to install the dependencies

# Things learned from this project:

* sort method in JavaScript is descructive. When I called json_data.sort { ... }, it changes json_data and so that's why I can just pass json_data
